    1. Async: It's like only allowing one person on a rollercoaster at a time when there are five seats. And waiting for the ride to finish before the next person can get on.
    2. Parrallelism: Five people get on ride, and five people get off the ride, until the line is empty.

Generators: Have locally pausable stacks. A function that can pause within itself.

Events ( +promises):
